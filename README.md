# Making audio plugins
## About this project
The purpose of this repository is to record my progress in developing audio plugins (VSTs) using C++ and the WDL-OL library, following the tutorials on [Martin Finke's blog](http://www.martin-finke.de/blog/tags/making_audio_plugins.html).

I expect this to be a fun and challenging venture into fields I am not yet entirely familiar with:
- C++ 
- Digital signal processing (basic - advanced)
- GUI Development
- WDL_OL
- Developing software to be integrated into a host application (a DAW, in this case)
